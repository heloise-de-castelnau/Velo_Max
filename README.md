# STUDY PROJECT REPORT : DATABASE MANAGEMENT "VELOMAX"

## Overview

Subject : "VéloMax is a company that sells bicycles and spare parts for bicycles. Given the huge growth in sales volume in recent years, Max Legrand, the owner of VéloMax, wishes to have a new database in order to better manage sales and customers."

In this school project, we had to develop a database management for Mr Legrand, in order for him or other bicycle companies to : 
- Create, delete and update suppliers/clients/ordes/stock
- self managment of the stock and if needed alert with direct order to suppliers
- daily statistical report 
- managment of clients subscriptions to different programs that give them discounts when ordering
- best clients and suppliers ( fast shipping, least expensive and reactive)
- sales analyzes ( mean price, bicycles and spare parts)
